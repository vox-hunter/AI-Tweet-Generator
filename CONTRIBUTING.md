# Contributing to Tweet Generator

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Tweet Generator. It's people like you that make Tweet Generator such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [issues](https://github.com/vox-hunter/AI-Tweet-Generator/issues) if there's something similar. You can then create a new issue providing as much information as possible.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/325-add-button
```

## Get the test suite running

Make sure you're running the tests on your machine and they're all passing.

## Make the change

Work on the code to fix the issue or add the feature. Make sure to add tests and ensure they're passing.

## Send a pull request

When your branch is looking good, squash your commits into a single one with a good commit message, then push your changes to your fork and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vox-hunter/AI-Tweet-Generator/pulls).

## And finally

Thanks!
